# Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to begin designing my project portfolio.
- I built this project so that I have a chance to start collecting my works to begin a career in Back-End development.
-This solves the problem of employers asking for a portfolio and certification; this will eventually be hyperlinked to a resume.
- I learned that to get over a hump you must find a video that explains the issue rather well.
