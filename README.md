## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project was to begin designing my projrct portfolio.
- I built this project so that I have a chance to start collecting my works to begin a career in development.
-This solves the problem of employers asking for a portfolio and will eventually be hyperlinked to a resume.
- I learned that to get over a hump you must find a video that explains the issue rather well.
