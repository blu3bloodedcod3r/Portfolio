# Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to re-design my project portfolio using React and linking my resume.
- I adjusted this project so that I can be employer ready and searching for Web-development positions.
- This solves the problem of employers having to ask for a portfolio and I may send them one that is already at the ready to be viewed by hiring managers.
- I learned that reacts makes styling easier so that JSX can be used and files can be smaller so they load faster
